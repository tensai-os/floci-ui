# Floci UI

Floci UI is a local web console for [Floci](https://github.com/floci-io/floci), the free local AWS emulator.

It is designed to feel familiar to AWS Console users while staying honest about the current implementation: the UI only renders real data returned by Floci-compatible APIs. If a service or operation is not wired yet, the screen stays empty or shows an explicit placeholder. No fake resources, demo rows, or mock service data are shown in normal mode.

## Why Floci UI?

Floci exposes AWS-compatible APIs on `http://localhost:4566`. That is ideal for SDKs, CLI scripts, and automated tests, but day-to-day local development also needs a visual layer:

- See which Floci server the UI is connected to.
- Browse real local AWS resources without leaving the browser.
- Inspect service state without inventing resources.
- Use CloudWatch logs and metrics as the telemetry surface.
- Keep unsupported screens explicit instead of hiding gaps behind dummy data.

## Relationship to Floci Core

Floci core is the emulator. Floci UI is only the console layer.

The UI does not create custom backend endpoints. It talks to Floci using AWS-compatible protocols:

| Protocol | Used by |
|---|---|
| REST XML | S3 |
| AWS Query | SQS, SNS |
| AWS JSON 1.0 | DynamoDB, CloudWatch Metrics |
| AWS JSON 1.1 | CloudWatch Logs |
| REST JSON | Lambda |

## Current UI Status

These percentages describe UI coverage for the connected Floci service, not backend completeness. Floci core supports more operations than this UI currently exposes.

| Service | UI coverage | Current UI status |
|---|---:|---|
| S3 | 95% | Full bucket and object lifecycle. List, create, delete buckets. Browse objects by prefix with folder navigation. Upload, download, delete, bulk-delete, and copy objects. Read object metadata and tags. Read/update bucket tags and versioning. |
| DynamoDB | 95% | Full table lifecycle. List, describe, create, delete tables. Scan with configurable limit. Query by partition key with sort-key operators. Create, edit, and delete items via JSON editor. Key schema badges and typed value rendering. |
| SQS | 100% | Full queue lifecycle and management. List, create, delete, purge queues. Send single (FIFO-aware) and batch messages. Peek and delete messages. Queue tags. Editable configuration. Dead-letter queue config and redrive. |
| Lambda | 90% | Full function detail. List functions, filter by name or runtime. Detail drawer with runtime, state, architecture, ARN, handler, memory, timeout, code size, environment variables. Invoke with JSON payload, response display, and log tail. Delete function. |
| SNS | 90% | Full topic lifecycle. List, create (standard and FIFO), delete topics. List and manage subscriptions per topic (sqs, lambda, http, https, email, sms). Subscribe and unsubscribe endpoints. Publish messages with optional subject. |
| CloudWatch | 90% | Full log management. List, filter, create, delete log groups with retention policy. List and delete log streams. Browse and search log events. Rich parsing of Floci ingestor events into HTTP method/status/latency rows. List metrics and alarms. Auto-refresh every 10 s. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>DynamoDB — 95%</strong></summary>

### DynamoDB

Implemented:

- List tables.
- Create table (partition key, optional sort key, PAY_PER_REQUEST or PROVISIONED billing).
- Delete table.
- Describe table metadata (status, item count, size, billing mode, key schema).
- Key schema badges (HASH in amber, RANGE in purple).

- Client-side search filter across all visible rows.

Remaining gaps:

| Feature | Floci API availability |
|---|---|
| TTL view and update | `DescribeTimeToLive` / `UpdateTimeToLive` |
| Batch write and bulk delete | `BatchWriteItem` |
| GSI / LSI management | `UpdateTable` |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>SQS — 100%</strong></summary>

### SQS

Implemented:

- List queues.
- Create queue (standard and FIFO, content-based deduplication, visibility timeout, retention period).

- Purge queue with inline amber warning.
- Select queue and read attributes.
- Show message counts.
- Edit queue configuration via the Settings tab (visibility timeout, delivery delay, receive wait time, max message size, retention).
- Send message — FIFO-aware: a message group id is sent for FIFO queues, and a deduplication id is generated only when the queue does not use content-based deduplication.
- Send message batch (up to 10, with an explicit over-limit warning).
- Peek messages without consuming them.
- Delete individual messages after peek.
- Queue tags: list, add, and remove.
- Dead-letter queue configuration: set and clear a redrive policy targeting another queue.
- Dead-letter redrive: list the source queues this queue serves, and start a message move task to send their messages back.

Known limitations:

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Redrive task history | Floci core accepts `StartMessageMoveTask`, but its `ListMessageMoveTasks` handler currently returns no results — the task table stays empty until Floci core is fixed |
| Per-message visibility control | `ChangeMessageVisibility` is not yet surfaced |

- CloudWatch ingestor: automatically captures all Floci API calls into `/floci/{service}` log groups as the user navigates the console.

Remaining gaps:

| Feature | Floci API availability |
|---|---|
| Metric graphing | `GetMetricStatistics` / `GetMetricData` |
| Alarm creation and edit | `PutMetricAlarm` |
| Create log stream from UI | `CreateLogStream` — streams are currently created by the ingestor only |

| Subscription confirmation flow | Protocol-specific — email/http require confirmation before `SubscriptionArn` is active |
| Subscription filter policies | `SetSubscriptionAttributes` |

</details>

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer.
- pnpm 9 or newer.
- Bun, required by `packages/api`.
- Docker, if you want to run Floci with the published container image.

### 1. Start Floci core

Floci UI needs a running Floci core server before the API and frontend can load resources.

Terminal 1, using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name floci \
  -p 4566:4566 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e FLOCI_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 \
  -u root \
  floci/floci:latest
```

Terminal 1, or using a local clone of `floci-io/floci`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/floci-io/floci.git ../floci
cd ../floci
./mvnw clean quarkus:dev
```

In both cases, verify Floci core is reachable:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4566/_floci/health
```

For local development, the UI needs all three of these components running:

1. Floci core on `http://localhost:4566`.
2. The Floci UI API backend on `http://localhost:3001` via `pnpm dev:api`.
3. The frontend dev server on `http://localhost:3000` via `pnpm dev`.

The frontend expects `/api/*` endpoints from `packages/api`, so running only `pnpm dev` is not enough.

### 2. Install Floci UI dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure local environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Default `.env` values:

```bash
FLOCI_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4566
VITE_MOCK_MODE=false
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test
PORT=3001
```

`.env.example` already includes `VITE_MOCK_MODE=false` for real Floci usage.

### 4. Start the local API

Terminal 2:

```bash
pnpm dev:api
```

This starts `packages/api` on `http://localhost:3001` and points AWS SDK clients at `FLOCI_ENDPOINT`.

### 5. Start the frontend

Terminal 3:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open the UI:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

## Environment

```bash
FLOCI_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4566
VITE_MOCK_MODE=false
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test
PORT=3001
```

Floci credentials can be any non-empty value for local development. They are required because the AWS SDK expects credentials, but Floci does not require real AWS credentials.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm type-check
pnpm build
```

## Design Direction

The target experience is a practical AWS-console-style interface:

- Dense, service-oriented navigation.
- Clear connection state in the top bar.
- Real resource counts.
- Dedicated pages for high-usage services.
- Empty states when no resources exist.
- Placeholders when a service is not wired yet.
- No decorative data or fake operational metrics.

## Contributing

When adding service UI, follow these rules:

- Use existing Floci AWS-compatible endpoints.
- Do not add custom backend endpoints just for the UI unless the core project explicitly accepts that contract.
- Prefer real empty states over sample data.
- Keep service status percentages updated in this README.
- Add verification notes for any newly wired operations.
